Values of the hydrodynamic radius of SDS aggregates are obtained. The mean hydrodynamic radius of the aggregates was found over the temperature region from 295 to 340{\thinspace}K. The autocorrelation function (ACF) for a single, micron-sized diethylene glycol droplet levitating in the electrodynamic trap was found and analyzed. At least two types of droplet motion in the trap were identified.",
